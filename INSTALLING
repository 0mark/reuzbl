* Arch Linux:
  pkgbuild @ http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=25972

* From source:

$ git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl.git
[ $ git checkout master/experimental ] # master == fairly stable.  experimental is more bleeding edge
$ cd uzbl
$ make
$ sudo make install

Dependencies:
libwebkit 1.1.4 or higher
gtk 2 something something
pkgconfig (for Make/gcc)

Optional:
dmenu, zenity, bash for the sample scripts

You will have the program in /usr/bin and various sample scripts, a sample config, sample bookmarks file and some documentation in /usr/share/uzbl. You
will probably want to change the scripts to behave more like you want, so copy the scripts to your home dir. If you save your config as
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uzbl/config (this expands to ~/.config/uzbl/config on most systems) it will be recognized automatically. You can also pass the path to
the config file with the --config parameter.
