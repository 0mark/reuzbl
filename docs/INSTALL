Packages
--------
[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org) is our distro of choice, and the distro we use for testing.

You can find a [PKGBUILD](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=25972) on the AUR, which installs the latest
from the master branch. You can edit the PKGBUILD to change to any other
branch you want.

For other distros, see [reuzbl.org/wiki/howtos](http://www.reuzbl.org/wiki/howtos)

From source
-----------
You can pull the code from git or get a tagged tarball.

	$ git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/reuzbl.git
	[ $ git checkout origin/experimental ] # optional. see below
	$ cd reuzbl
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
If you want to remove reuzbl again, you can issue:

	$ make uninstall

Tarballs can be pulled from [github.com/Dieterbe/reuzbl/downloads](http://github.com/Dieterbe/reuzbl/downloads)

Though you can only get tagged versions from the master branch, which may be older then what you'll have through git.

Dependencies
------------
* git (for downloading)
* pkgconfig (for Make/gcc)
* libwebkit 1.1.4 or higher
* libsoup 2.24 or higher (dep for webkit/gtk+)
* gtk 2.14 or higher

Optional/Recommended
--------------------
The following tools are quite useful, and some of them are used in the
sample scripts:

* socat (for socket communication)
* dmenu (with vertical patch)
* zenity
* bash
* python (cookies.py)
* perl (formfiller.pl)

File locations
--------------
After installing - using either method - you will find:

* /usr/bin : reuzbl
* /usr/share/reuzbl/docs/ : documentation files included with reuzbl. (readme, checklist, .. )
* /usr/share/reuzbl/examples: sample scripts, config files and a sample data (boomarks, .. )

You will probably want to change the scripts to behave more like you want, so copy the scripts to your home dir. If you save your config as
$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/reuzbl/config (this expands to ~/.config/reuzbl/config on most systems) it will be recognized automatically. You can also pass the path to
the config file with the --config parameter.

You're free to store your personal stuff where you want, but we think the [XDG basedir spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html)
is very useful for keeping a clean home directory, so we recommend:

* $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/reuzbl/config* (~/.config/reuzbl/config on most systems): config file
* $XDG\_DATA\_HOME/reuzbl (~/.local/share/reuzbl on most systems): bookmarks file, history file. and "scripts" directory with scripts

Git Repo's & branches
--------------------
* Main official repo:
  http://github.com/Dieterbe/reuzbl
- master -> reuzbl stable branch
- experimental -> bleeding edge stuff that may break. after QA Dieter merges into his master

* Most contributors & developers also have their clones on github (http://github.com/dusanx, http://github.com/Barrucadu/reuzbl, ...).
  They may be developing specific features, which get merged into Dieters experimental branch
