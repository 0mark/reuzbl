Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl_pid
  - 'forward', 'back', 'http://www.blah.com', are the supported commands.

Bugs:
  - Segfault occurs on shutdown, almost definitely FIFO related (I'm not seeing this bug now, but the warning was here when I forked the code and I haven't touched the FIFO bit)
