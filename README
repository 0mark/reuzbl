Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl_pid
  - Commands are now grouped by function:
       nav forward
       nav back
       nav reload
       nav stop
       view zoom +
       view zoom -

Bugs:
  - Segfault occurs on shutdown, almost definitely FIFO related (I'm not seeing this bug now, but the warning was here when I forked the code and I haven't touched the FIFO bit)
  - Segfaults when using zoom commands (happens when max zoom already reached?).

Notes:
  - I push the code most times I save any changes, regardless of whether it actually compiles or not. Thus, the code here should be regarded as highly experimental.
  - If you use any of my code in another fork of uzbl (or anything really) it'd be nice to get a mention.

Todo:
  - Change commands to a few characters long.
  - Command/insert modes (ESC to switch, methinks).
  - Automatically run a command when typed (no need to press enter).
  - Support for arguments to commands (argc/argv-like structure?).
  - Support for binding keyboard shortcuts in config file.
  - Support for setting home page in config file.
