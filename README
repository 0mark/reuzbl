Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl_pid
  - Commands are as follows:
       f - forward
       b - back
       r - refresh
       s - stop
       z+ - zoom in
       z- - zoom out
  - If a command is appended with a number, run it that many times (eg: z+10 would zoom in 10 times).
  - Press ESC to toggle the mode line.
  - Press enter after typing a command in the mode line to use it.

Bugs:
  - Segfault occurs on shutdown, almost definitely FIFO related (I'm not seeing this bug now, but the warning was here when I forked the code and I haven't touched the FIFO bit)
  - Segfaults when using zoom commands (happens when max zoom already reached?).

Notes:
  - I push the code most times I save any changes, regardless of whether it actually compiles or not. Thus, the code here should be regarded as highly experimental.
  - If you use any of my code in another fork of uzbl (or anything really) it'd be nice to get a mention.

Todo:
  - Change commands to a few characters long.
  - Support for arguments to commands (argc/argv-like structure?).
  - Support for binding keyboard shortcuts in config file.
  - Support for setting home page in config file.
