Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl
  - 'forward', 'back, 'http://www.blah.com', at the supported commands.
  - Must be a blank character at the end (eg: newline)

Todo:
  - Include PID in FIFO name to allow multiple instances.
  - Delete FIFO upon terminating.

Bugs:
  - Segfaults sometimes occur, no idea why.
