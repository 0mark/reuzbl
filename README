Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl_pid
  - 'forward', 'back', 'http://www.blah.com', are the supported commands.

Bugs:
  - Segfault occurs on shutdown, almost definitely FIFO related (I'm not seeing this bug now, but the warning was here when I forked the code and I haven't touched the FIFO bit)

Notes:
  - I push the code most times I save any changes, regardless of whether it actually compiles or not. Thus, the code here should be regarded as highly experimental.
  - If you use any of my code in another fork of uzbl (or anything really) it'd be nice to get a mention.
