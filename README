Control:
  - FIFO opened in /tmp/uzbl_pid
  - Commands are now grouped by function:
       nav forward
       nav back
       nav reload
       nav stop
       view zoom +
       view zoom -

Bugs:
  - Segfault occurs on shutdown, almost definitely FIFO related (I'm not seeing this bug now, but the warning was here when I forked the code and I haven't touched the FIFO bit)
  - Segfaults when using zoom commands (happens when max zoom already reached?).

Notes:
  - I push the code most times I save any changes, regardless of whether it actually compiles or not. Thus, the code here should be regarded as highly experimental.
  - If you use any of my code in another fork of uzbl (or anything really) it'd be nice to get a mention.
