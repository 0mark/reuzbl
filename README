Copy the eFormFiller.sh to $XDG_DATA_HOME/uzbl/scripts/
In the Uzbl config file add bindings(for example):

    set formfiller = spawn @scripts_dir/eFormFiller
    @bind    za        = @{eFormFiller}.sh add
    @bind    ze        = @{eFormFiller}.sh edit
    @bind    zn        = @{eFormFiller}.sh new
    @bind    zl        = @{eFormFiller}.sh load

scripts_dir is set by default in uzbl config

If NEW action is taken, then the script will generate 
new file with formfields for current domain or will
overrite existing one.

EDIT action will call an editor (configure it in the script) 
with curent domain profiles

ADD action add another profile to current domain. Remember to name
the profiles, by default the have a name with random numbers

LOAD will load formfields or if there is more then one profile, it will
call dmenu first to choose the profile you want to fill in the form

Enjoy
