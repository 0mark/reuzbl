# This is a unique Link following Script for reuzbl. Instead of just numberize
# visible Links in the Viewspace, dmenu ist utilized to select from all Links
# by the Title of the Link. This is way more convinient for often used sites
# where the user knows all links by surename.
#
# There are a lot of Problems. Multiple Links of the same Title arent handled
# properly (only the first is selectable). Instead of the "title" (whatever that
# may be) just the innerHTML is used. There will be Bugs, too.
#
# For bugreports, fixes, feature requests or correction of my writing call me
# be jabber or Email: 0mark at unserver.de
#
# getLinks.js is salvaged from follow_Numbers.js
# the Socket Object from the reuzbl-ctrl.pl script.
#
# TODO
# soon:
# - find and use the biggest textnode child of an anchor as title (JS)
# - if none found, use alt, title, ... attribute from images, ... (JS)
# - remove or change all non-ascii char (Perl) (or patch utf8 into dmenu)
# - numberize multiple titles (Perl)
# !soon:
# - more fastness, maybe use less packages or recode in lua or c or such alike
# - find everything clickable (does this makes sense?)
