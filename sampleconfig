# example uzbl config. in a real config, we should obey the xdg spec

# all keys in the behavior group are optional.  if not set, the corresponding behavior is disabed.
# bindings_internal denote keys to trigger actions internally in uzbl
# bindings_external denote keys to trigger scripts outside uzbl

# keyboard behavior is vimstyle by default (all actions -> 1 key). set
# always_insert_mode to always be in insert mode and disable going out of it.
# if you do this, make sure you've set a modkey so you can reach the actions
# from insert mode by combining them with the modkey
