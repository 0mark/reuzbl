This file contains all things that are/should be working.
When you have been working on something, use this list to verify that you did not cause any regressions (things that worked before, but got broken).
Also, when you finish a new feature, add it to this list so that everyone knows about it, can play with it, and can test it.

Also testers and interested people can use this list to see what uzbl is about, and report problems if they find items listed here that do not work.

* commandline switches --uri "http://.." and --config should behave as expected
* --help and -? should show help
* config loading: loading of settings, bindings and handlers from config file
* fifo: type this in your shell after starting uzbl:
  echo 'uri http://www...' > <fifo path here>'
  where <fifo path> is printed on stdout during program startup.  Also "back" , "forward", "refresh" (basically all actions defined in `static Command commands` should behave as expected)
* history logging: the script as defined in sample config should write history entries (date,time, url) into the file defined in the script (by default ./extra/history.sh and /tmp/uzbl.history)
* invocations of external commands: you'll see it on stdout everytime uzbl calls an external script/program. the invocations should work and none of the arguments passed should be null/garbage/.. .
  all should be valid strings and contain things like the pid, fifo file, config file,.. (see README for details).
* XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (+ default values) fully supported and working (looks for a config file called 'uzbl/config').
* --uri can be specified without http:// -- if missing will be prepended.
* Download completely finished
* Open in new window partially finished: target _new works, from popup meny does not work yet

TODO: add stuff about internal/external keybinds, mod key, insert mode, status bar,
behavior settings,....

TODO: add 'http://' to url if there is no substr '://'
