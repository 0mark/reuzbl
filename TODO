ASAP
* implement all the ideas from README
* get a logo
* improve site
* when launching new instance, don't just try 'uzbl' and then './uzbl', rather launch a new uzbl in the same way the current uzbl instance was started. (same command, same arguments, except --uri)
* where to put proxy config? webkit support?
* implement XDG basedir spec (config is done, but not cache/data, which I presume we'll need at some point)
* check configured commands if they end on .sh so users don't need to prepend /bin/<shell>
* implement a more advanced dmenu alike that behaves like FF's awesomebar and where you can search in url + window title
* recognize -h with GOption?
* implement a vimperator-like link following scheme.  but let user pick his favorite characters to construct the "link identifiers" with.
* add a keybind to hand the current url to an external scrips, so you can edit it and/or store it in the primary and secondary clipboards
* use http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-Hash-Tables.html#g-hash-table-insert for tracking bindings and wherever we use structs and ugly loops
* fifo -> socket. so you can do question-response. socket is slightly more complicated so we'll need to create a uzblctrl (half done - commands can't yet send data back)
* select/fork based instead of the pthread stuff -> drops dependency, more lightweight.
* on website, see if we can <pre><?php include('..'); ?></pre> the documentation inside the uzbl project itself, so we need to maintain the stuff on only 1 place
* see if we can use the github bugtracker (anonymous posting allowed?)
* allow user to change bindings for navigation (up,down,left,right, page up, page down etc)and use vim-like defaults
* put on uzbl.org that you can use http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/issues after registering
* make default size configurable, and optional
* on uzbl.org commits overview: add date+time and repository
* how to handle different content types? (text-plain, image/png, application/pdf,... maybe a map of content-type to uzbl/command
  xdg already has a spec for this i think
  different "opening" modes (open as configured vs ask before opening)
  integration with download and new window thingies?
* see if/how we can remove /bin/bash from scripts
* unify internal and external bindings. 
* unify command triggering, whether they came in through fifo or keybind
* add to bottom /* vi: set et ts=4: */
* ideal uri editor: awesome mode like FF, some keyb shortcuts (erase search string, go to end/begin of string,..), history (if you patch dmenu to be in vertical mode and you order correctly, that's it), support copy paste
* get rid of the home page concept. allow user to make keybinds to go to one or more "homepages". a home page is nothing special.
* blinking cursor when not in insert mode is confusing.  i suggest dimming it's color if possible
* open in new window -> uzbl: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :0.0.


SOMEDAY:
check if we can make the settings loading less hard coded. eg( keep a list of all settings, and for each one, try to load it)
figure out caching with webkit and in general how we can speed up everything
figure out how webkit intercepts key input
