* implement all the ideas from README
* see if we can get rid of gtk.  I need no widgets at all, only the webkit page display no scrollbar, no statusbar.
* figure out caching with webkit and in general how we can speed everything up
* where to put proxy config? webkit support?
* can we change the behavior of the rendering? eg to add numbers to all hyperlinks
* figure out how webkit intercepts key input
